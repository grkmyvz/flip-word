# Flip Word

## Description

A simple Next.js project that displays a card with a word from the Oxford 3000 English word list. When the card is clicked, it flips with an animation to reveal the Turkish translation of the word. There is also a button that, when clicked, displays a new random word on the card.

Currently, the JSON data contains a single Turkish translation for each English word. In future updates, multiple Turkish translations for each English word will be added to provide more comprehensive meanings.
